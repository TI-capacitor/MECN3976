# MECN3976 – Mechatronics with PCB Design

This is a repository for a course in my aerospace engineering minor.  
Here you will find Arduino C++ scripts for a variety of components commonly found in most Arduino kits.

## Contents

- Example Arduino C++ scripts for different components
- Practice code for mechatronics and PCB-related labs
- Final project code (coming soon)

## Final Project (coming soon)

Over the next few days, I will:

- Add the script for my final project
- Upload a Youtube video presentation of the project
