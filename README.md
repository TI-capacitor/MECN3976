#MECN3976 - Mechatronics with PCB Design
Hello, this is a repository for a class in my aeorospace engineering minor. You will find arduino c++ scripts
for a variety of components found in most arduino kits. Over the next few days i will add a script for my final
project and a video to the presentation of said project.
